# hello-world
My first GutHub repository
Hi everyone,
This is my first GitHub repository.
I like coding across a variety of plaforms including Mac OS X and Linux
I am hoping I can use this to further my profile.
I have now made a change to this readme to make it more accessible.

I have learned a little more about GitHub and so have placed some more information in this work
